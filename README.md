# nixos-dotfiles

This repository has my system configuration. I use NixOS for my package management, but for the
sake of portability, I have regular dotfiles to configure a lot of the system behavior.

- `dotfiles/` contains what will be symlinked into the `/home/` directory using `stow`
- `nixos/` contains a NixOS flake that can be used to configure the system

I don't konw what I am doing, I am learning as I go.
